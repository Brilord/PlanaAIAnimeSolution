# 🌌 Transparent Anime-Themed AI Client

**“Ready when you are.”**

A lightweight, transparent AI client built for developers who love clean interfaces and a touch of anime-inspired calm.
It blends productivity tools, deep AI integration, and an atmospheric visual layer — turning your workspace into something that actually *feels* alive.

## ✨ Overview

This isn’t just another chat window.
The client floats above your desktop like glass — semi-transparent, responsive, and quietly animated.
It’s designed for developers who want their AI tools to be **present, not intrusive**.

The anime-styled interface is more than decoration: it creates focus.
Minimal color distractions, soft motion, and a sense of space — so your thoughts have room to move.
